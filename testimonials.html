<pre><h3><center>Respected teachers and principal of SNBP school, Chikhali. We shifted to this
    area in 2015, our son Hrishikesh was 2.5 years old Me and my wife were very 
    skeptical and critical about the locality and especially quality of schooling.
    SNBP was our obvious choice, looking at its presence and reputation across Pune.
    aproached the school, and to our pleasant surprise, we could note, the vision of
     the school</center></h3></pre>
